## The Game of Life

Devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970, The Game of Life, or simply Life, is a "zero-player game" where the game keeps
playing by itself ad infinitum. Following a set of few and simple rules, the board keeps updating alone, creating new scenarios every update.
The player only sets the initial scenario just so Life can continue.

There is a board that works as a 2D grid of cells. Each cell can be either dead or alive, and this state may or may not change every time the game
updates. For each update, the game evalutes a few rules for each cell:

- 1: if a dead cell has no living neighbours, it stays dead.
- 2: if a living cell has less than 2 living neighbours, it dies of "underpopulation".
- 3: if a living cell has more than 3 living neighbours, it dies of "overpopulation".
- 4: if a dead cell has exactly 3 living neighbours, it becomes alive out of "reproduction".

Each cell has at least 3 and at most 8 neighbours, and their fate in the next "age" depends on the disposition of the "current age".

## :grey_question: How it works

There are two classes: ``Cell`` and ``Board``. Each cell stores its ``x`` and ``y`` coordinates, as well as its state. The state is 
represented by a property called ``alive``, which can be either **True** or **False**. Cells also store the coordinates of all of its 
neighbours, just so it can evaluate the game rules every update. Should its state change, the ``toggle`` function is called.

The ``Board`` is composed by cells and works as a list of lists of cells to emulate a 2D array in Python. When instantiated, the Board object
receives two values: ``rows`` and ``columns``, each representing the size of its axis in the board. It then creates a completely dead board
in the specified dimensions. 

It is possible to create custom boards by using the ``generate`` function. Once created, the Board object can call the function, receiving the
new board as a list of lists of integers that can be either 0 (dead) or 1 (alive). Based on that, a new Board with real Cell objects is going to
be generated.

One can also get/set values to the Board elements by using its row and column coordinates as: board_instance[row, column].

Finally, the Board's ``update`` method toggles every cell according to the game rules.

## Example:

```
from board import Board

b = Board(0, 0) # initialized an empty Board

my_pattern = [
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 1, 1, 1, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]

b.generate(my_pattern)

print(b)

print('\n---------\n')

b.update()

print(b)
```

The output should be:

```
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0

---------

0 0 0 0 0
0 0 1 0 0
0 0 1 0 0
0 0 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
```
